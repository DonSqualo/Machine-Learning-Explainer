# Machine-Learning-Explainer

You found the pieces of paper that you can play with! This is the Notebook we will work with. 

(If you are confused, here is the first part of this writing: ["Make Machines Learn" Explainer](https://www.remnote.io/a/heyes-zero-knowledge-neural-net-course/637682e939cf6f9d4989bbe2))

First, touch the green field saying "Code", then "Download ZIP". 

You should have the code now, but what's that? We can't read it! For you to get it so fast, someone has turned it into paper flying machine. So we have to first make it flat again, so press "Extract All" on your computer.

Now you can send "Explainer.ipynb" to Paperspace! By the way, .ipynb tells us that there is Jupyter language on this paper.
