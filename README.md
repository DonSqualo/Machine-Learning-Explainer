# Machine-Learning-Explainer

You found the pieces of paper that you can play with! This is the Notebook we will work with. 

(If you are confused, here is the first part of this writing: ["Make Machines Learn" Explainer](https://www.remnote.io/a/heyes-zero-knowledge-neural-net-course/637682e939cf6f9d4989bbe2))

First, touch the green field saying "Code", then "Download Zip". Someone has made a paper flying machine out of it though! We have to first make it flat again, so press "Extract All" on your computer.
Now you can send "Explainer.ipynb" to Paperspace!
